Menagerie
================================

Lightweight PHP 5.4 Namespaced Framework

--------------------------------

Note: I just merged in a huge branch that was the PascalCaseRefactor so

--------------------------------

This project is Pre-Alpha. That means I can change what I want when I
want and there is nothing you can do about it. Current projections have
me going Beta (and therefore, being mostly stable) this August.
